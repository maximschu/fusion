This folder has the **3 bases (camera, lidar, radar)**, **camera clip** and an **assembled file** with 3 bases piece together. 

Here's the jigsaw idea for linking the components -> ensure always in same position

Everything can easily be changed so if you want to try anything specific or want a new design i am seriously happy to do it 

### Notes:
- 3cm height for all (current base for camera is 2cm, lidar should be <2cm)
- Lidar notch not added atm bcs idk if it needs to be on the right side (if youre standing in front view) or can be other side - personally think left side would be good bcs cameras cable is also on left - cleaner look for cables
- Radar legs slide into the outlines - the barrier there to clip it in place
- also for radar its a 19mm x 10mm which is smaller than their max. build (250mm x 250mm x 200mm) - but idk if lab will happily print it - easy fix tho so dw
- Jigsaw but can be slided in and not wedged in? - possibly looser but easier set up is what i was thinking and we can tape the sides to keep it steady or i can do a wedge design which is simple change - if its too tight reduce some mm on it should work?
- Camera attachment im hoping can clip onto the stand so itll always be in the same position
- Also for planning on where to put ir / positioning it in this setup - im thinking extending the camera clip and creating a little holder for it on top of camera - therefore same-ish field of vision
- This layout is based on what we had set up during calibration - i have ideas of jenga stacking the bases in a sense which would condense it space taken (kinda the same thing prev group were thinking but think jenga) but is it needed since everything bar lidar has terrible fov
