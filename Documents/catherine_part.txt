Referring to the Gantt chart presented at the end of the proposal, the tasks that need to be performed are listed under five headings: Assignments, Sensors, Sensor Fusion, Sensor Perception, and Other Sensors. The tasks listed under “Sensors” indicate what is needed to prepare the sensors for sensor fusion. Interpreting the data involves understanding what the graphs, charts, and data represent. Validating the data includes checking for consistency and determining how far the data deviates from the true value. The tasks listed under 'Sensor Gantt chart
Fusion' specify all the necessary steps to fuse sensor data. Offline fusion will initially be attempted with two sensors, gradually building up to three and four sensors. Additional sensors may be added later and have been accounted for under the heading “Other Sensors”. The main focus of the project is “Sensor Perception”. This section is dedicated to programming the sensor perception and ensuring it functions correctly with simulated data before testing the algorithms on an RC car or robot.

Radar 
The AWR1642 is a frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) millimetre wave (mmWave) radar that operates within the 76-81 GHz frequency range [1, 2]. The antennas   system consists of 4 receivers and 2 transmitters [2], making it a MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple Output) radar. Radio waves are emitted from the transmitters and reflect off the surfaces of objects. These reflected waves are received by the radar to calculate the objects' distance, angle and velocity [3]. The distance to an object is influenced by the time it takes for the radio waves to return [4]. Distance calculated by radar will be useful for object detection, as it operates reliably in all lighting and weather conditions, unlike optical and infrared sensors [2]. Furthermore, it is a high resolution sensor, making it easier to detect smaller object and distinguish between different objects [2].
The angle of the object provides it direction relative to the radar and is determined by the difference in angle received by multiple receivers, this is known at the angle-of-arrival (AoA) [6]. The use of angles can be implemented in object localization to find the direction of an object relative to the autonomous vehicle (AV). The velocity of the object is determined by the shift in frequency of the received signal in relation to the transmitted signal, this is known as the Doppler effect [6]. This information will be useful for tracking the speed of objects in the surrounding environment.
